  - "... My mom says I can\u2019t talk to strangers but I was so bored until you showed
    up. I don\u2019t know where my teacher is. She took us out here on a field trip
    to see all cities. We came from Flora and already saw Lumen. "

    is the most pretty planet and we have to take good care of it because it\u2019s
    where all the people used to live. "
  - "I wanted to catch the earth and bring it home so we can take care of it so I
    ran out there but I couldn\u2019t get close enough and now I\u2019m lost. Can
    you bring me back to where my teacher went?"
