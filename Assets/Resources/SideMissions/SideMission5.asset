  - Hello, this is Walter speaking, I am lost. Can someone come and find me?
  missionPickupDialog:
  - "Oh good day to you! Good thing I see you here, I\u2019ve been a bit lost. You
    see, my older brother makes these musical instruments out of space trash. "
  - 'Seeing the earth and what people are doing to it made him want to live a sustainable
    life so we moved away from Lumen. '
  - "Life was good but now that he is ill and can\u2019t walk, I have to help him.
    Unfortunately though, I am getting older too. My eyes are getting weary and I
    keep getting lost out here. I found enough space trash for him to make one final
    instrument. "
  - "Can you bring me back to him? If you do so I\u2019ll board your ship."
  missionEndDialog:
  - Thank you kind stranger, hope you have a good day!
