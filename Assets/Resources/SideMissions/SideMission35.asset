  missionStartDialog:
  - Hey, am lost. Want to be found. Gotta go home. See ya.
  missionPickupDialog:
  - "Hello, have you come to rescue me? That\u2019s great! I\u2019ve been waiting
    for a few hours for you to come, but to be fair \u2026 "
  - "I don\u2019t even mind you being late. I have been watching the earth the whole
    time. Seeing it like this makes me think about how small we really are. It\u2019s
    the one planet we were meant to live on and look what we\u2019re doing to it. "
  - "I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a longer time but maybe it\u2019s time to
    finally quit my job in Lumen and look for a greater purpose in my life. That\u2019s
    it, I\u2019m going to Flora as soon as possible."
  missionEndDialog:
  - Thank you for helping me!
