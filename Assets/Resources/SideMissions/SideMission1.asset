  - " Oh hey! I\u2019m so happy to finally see someone! My name is Henry. My wife
    and I were flying around to search for a nice little cottage to spend the upcoming
    holidays in. My wife likes her livingspace big, probably so that her ego can fit
    in while I like them simple and clean."
  - "After a while we got into a fight and that\u2019s when she said she couldn\u2019t
    take it anymore and so she pressed the emergency eject button and launched me
    into space. Basically that\u2019s how I ended up here. Man, I sure wish I\u2019d
    be back home in Lumen right now.\r\n"
