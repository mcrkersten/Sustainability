  - My wife and I were flying around to search for a nice little cottage to spend
    the upcoming holidays in. She likes her livingspace big, probably so that her
    ego can fit in while I like them simple and clean.
  - "After a while we got into a fight and that\u2019s when she said she couldn\u2019t
    take it anymore and so she pressed the emergency eject button and launched me
    into space.  "
  - "Basically that\u2019s how I ended up here. Man, I sure wish I\u2019d be back
    home in Lumen right now.  Basically that\u2019s how I ended up here. Man, I sure
