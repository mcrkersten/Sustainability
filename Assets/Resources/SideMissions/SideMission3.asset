  - "Oh hello dear, did they send you to pick me up? I came out here because I\u2019ve
    lost a data chip which contains all my work. You see I am a writer and I have
    been spending hours, days and months even to write my book. It\u2019s about the
    overview effect."
  - "To gain inspiration I\u2019ve visited my hometown but it was so dark there, it
    took me ages to find the data! When I found it I was thrilled! Thrilled and a
    bit lost \u2026 but here you are! "
  - "To reward you for saving me I\u2019ll give you my favorite song which was also
    on the drive, maybe it inspires you too. Can you bring me back to my hometown?"
