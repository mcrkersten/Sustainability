  - "Hello, Aletta here. I\u2019d like someone to come and pick me up."
  - "I\u2019m on a mission and I need to go back home..."
  missionPickupDialog:
  - "Oh hello dear, did they send you to pick me up? I came out here because I\u2019ve
    lost a data chip which contains all my work. You see I am a writer and I have
    been spending hours, days and months even to write my book. "
  - "It\u2019s about the overview effect. To gain inspiration I\u2019ve visited my
    hometown but it was so dark there, it took me ages to find the data! When I found
    it I was thrilled! Thrilled and a bit lost \u2026 "
  - But here you are! Can you bring me back to my hometown?
  missionEndDialog:
  - 'Thank you so much, do some research about the Overview effect and educate yourself
    on the matter. Teach your kids when you grow old and spread the message. '
  - Goodbye!
