  - "Hey it\u2019s Nancy speaking. My research went great, it\u2019s good to be back
    out in the field. I can see that the soil has been practically unharmed since
    the last time I came there to check. "
  - "Can you pick me up at Flora?\r\n"
  missionPickupDialog:
  - "Ah, thank you for picking me up. Did you have a good shift? My next destination
    is Lumen. Lumen tends to be a dark place, the people there are not at all concerned
    about durability or the state of the moon\u2026 "
  - "These moneygrubbers first treat the earth like trash and then go on to do the
    same to the moon. I\u2019m supposed to be subjective about it all but I can tell
    my secrets to you, can\u2019t I? Let\u2019s go find Lumen. "
  missionEndDialog:
  - "Thank you for dropping me off. I\u2019ll be thinking about you. I\u2019ll call
    you when I need you to get me out of this stinkhole."
