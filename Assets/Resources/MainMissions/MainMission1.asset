  - "Hello stranger, you\u2019re that new pilot they hired last week right? it\u2019s
    nice to meet you."
  - "It\u2019s good to finally have a new assistant. Since James retired I\u2019ve
    been forced to slack on my research. I hope we can get to work soon, the soil
    doesn\u2019t check itself around here!"
  - "I\u2019ve been asked to tell you about the system here. You work on a contract
    basis. To get a new contract, fly to the embassy."
  - ' Here you can accept all the contracts that show up. The contracts tell you to
    pick people up, you have to decide to which of the three cities you will bring
    them'
  - " If you bring the people to their preferred city, you will get a bonus. Oh, and
    don\u2019t forget to get fuel; you\u2019ll see how much you got left on the battery
    on your spaceship."
  - "If you get stranded without, you will have to be fueled in the fields. It\u2019ll
    cost you extra.\r"
  - But enough about your job, I was hoping you can take me to my first destination;
    Flora. I want to gather some soil samples to see how the moon is doing after all
    this mining,
  - " that\u2019s my job here you see. The people of Flora strive to live a sustainable
    life, it\u2019s always great to see how good the moon is doing around there. Let\u2019s
    go!"
