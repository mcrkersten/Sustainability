    nice to meet you."
  - "My name is nancy, it\u2019s nice to meet you. Since James retired I\u2019ve been
    forced to slack on my research. Please pick me up so we can get to work, the soil
    doesn\u2019t check itself around here!\r"
  missionPickupDialog:
  - "There you are! I\u2019ve been asked to tell you about the system here. You work
    on a contract basis. To get a new contract, fly to any city. Here you can see
    who your client is"

    to discover where they want to be taken. If you bring the people to their preferred
    city, you will get a bonus. '
  - "Oh, and don\u2019t forget to get fuel; you\u2019ll see how much you got left
    on the battery on your spaceship. If you get stranded without, you will have to
    be fueled in the fields. It\u2019ll cost you extra. "
  - "But enough about your job, I was hoping you can take me to my first destination;
    Flora. I want to gather some soil samples to see how the moon is doing after all
    this mining, that\u2019s my job here you see."
  - "The people of Flora strive to live a sustainable life, it\u2019s always great
    to see how good the moon is doing around there. Let\u2019s go! "
  missionEndDialog:
  - Thank you, I will get to work now. I will call you in a bit! Go do some missions!
