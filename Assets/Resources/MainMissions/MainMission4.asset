  - "Even the soil at the Capital got significantly worse\u2026 All these people.
    They first nearly destroy the earth and now they go on to the moon. They have
    been given the gift of a second chance and even here they suck the life out of
    everything. \r"
  - "I\u2019ve been thinking \u2026 let\u2019s nuke it. "
  - "No seriously just listen. Let\u2019s destroy all life here but still keep the
    moon itself intact. I\u2019ve been working on a biochemical weapon which simulates
    the effects of a nuclear weapon without harming the moon, I want you to find my
    final ingredients so that i can make it happen."
  - "I\u2019ve hidden some moon sprouts for the common people here but you should
    be able to them. Together we can live happily ever after and save the moon. After
    you\u2019ve found my sprouts, come find me somewhere around the Capital. See you
    in a bit!"
